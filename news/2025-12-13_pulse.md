# Pulse · December 13, 2025

The plugin ecosystem just exploded. Overnight, GitHub lit up with a dozen new Claude Code plugin repos—marketplaces, skill collections, workflow automations. Some are personal toolkits made public, others are production-ready frameworks with Linear integration and ADR generation. It's like watching a Cambrian explosion of developer tooling, except everyone's building for the same organism.

What's driving this? Two things: Anthropic's plugin spec finally clicked, and people are realizing that the best way to make Claude Code work for you is to teach it your workflow. Not abstract "best practices," but your actual process—your commit style, your testing philosophy, your code review checklist. The repos popping up this week aren't just code; they're crystallized developer opinions. And that's exactly what Claude needs to be useful.

## The Signal

### [Very Important Agents](https://nicknisi.com/posts/very-important-agents)

**[Nick Nisi](https://nicknisi.com)** · December 2025

Nick's been on the Changelog & Friends podcast talking about Claude Code, and this post is the companion piece—a tour of the plugins that actually make it into his daily workflow. It's not a tutorial; it's a field report from someone who's been living in Claude Code for months and has strong opinions about what works.

The real value here isn't the specific plugins (though those are useful), it's the meta-lesson: the best Claude Code setups are highly personal. Nick's workflow revolves around TypeScript, Vim keybindings, and a particular way of thinking about commits. His plugins encode those preferences. If you're still using vanilla Claude Code, this is a nudge to start building your own.

**Pulse insights:** Nick's approach validates what we've been doing with claude-mods. The plugin-per-workflow pattern scales. Worth checking if any of his specific plugins solve problems we've been reinventing.

### [How I Use Every Claude Code Feature](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature)

**[SSHH Blog](https://blog.sshh.io)** · December 2025

Shrivu Shankar wrote the brain dump we all needed—a systematic tour of Claude Code's feature surface, with concrete examples of when each thing actually matters. This isn't documentation; it's documentation filtered through heavy usage. The sections on hooks and skills are particularly good because they show the non-obvious interactions.

What stands out: Shrivu doesn't just list features, he explains when *not* to use them. The bit about avoiding over-engineering skills is gold. Sometimes a simple CLAUDE.md instruction beats a formal skill definition. That kind of judgment only comes from shipping real work with these tools.

**Pulse insights:** Required reading for anyone building plugins. The "when not to use it" framing should inform our own skill documentation. We should audit our skills for over-engineering.

### [AI Can't Read Your Docs](https://blog.sshh.io/p/ai-cant-read-your-docs)

**[SSHH Blog](https://blog.sshh.io)** · December 2025

A counterintuitive claim: AI coding agents often struggle with well-documented codebases because the docs are optimized for humans, not LLMs. Shrivu argues for "LLM-native documentation"—structured metadata, explicit capability descriptions, examples that double as test cases. It's a provocation, but it's backed by real friction he's encountered.

The deeper point: as AI agents become primary consumers of our code, we might need to write differently. Not dumbed-down, but differently structured. The implications for AGENTS.md files and skill descriptions are significant.

**Pulse insights:** This should change how we write skill descriptions. Less prose, more structured capability declarations. Worth experimenting with the LLM-native doc format he proposes.

## GitHub Discoveries

The `claude-code` topic exploded this week. Here's what stood out:

### [lazyclaude](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/lazyclaude)

**NikiforovAll** · A lazygit-style TUI for visualizing Claude Code customizations

Finally, someone built the obvious thing: a terminal UI for browsing your Claude Code setup. See your skills, agents, hooks, and commands in one navigable interface. It's early, but the concept is solid—configuration visibility matters when you're managing dozens of customizations.

**Pulse insights:** This solves a real problem. Our `.claude/` directory is getting unwieldy. Worth watching—or contributing to.

---

### [claude-deep-research](https://github.com/karanIPS/claude-deep-research)

**karanIPS** · Deep Research workflow for Claude Code · ⭐ 20

A pre-built configuration for running Claude Code in research mode—extended context, web search integration, structured output. It's essentially a "preset" for a specific use case, which is a pattern we haven't explored much.

**Pulse insights:** The "preset for use case" pattern is interesting. We could package claude-mods configurations as installable presets rather than just loose files.

---

### [claude-code-skills](https://github.com/levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills)

**levnikolaevich** · 29 production-ready skills for Agile workflows · ⭐ 11

The most ambitious skill collection we've seen—Epic/Story/Task management, Risk-Based Testing, ADR generation, all with Linear integration. It's opinionated (Agile-heavy), but the implementation quality is high. Real documentation, real tests.

**Pulse insights:** This is what mature Claude Code extensions look like. The Linear integration is particularly clever—skills that talk to external systems, not just Claude. Steal liberally.

---

### [gh-aw (GitHub Agentic Workflows)](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw)

**githubnext** · GitHub's official agentic workflows experiment · ⭐ 265

GitHub Next dropped this quietly: a framework for building AI-powered workflows that run on GitHub infrastructure. It's not Claude Code specific, but the patterns overlap heavily. Think of it as GitHub's answer to "what happens when agents need CI/CD."

**Pulse insights:** This is GitHub signaling where they're headed. The workflow-as-code patterns here might become standard. Worth understanding even if we don't adopt directly.

---

### [claude-code-openai](https://github.com/sar4daniela/claude-code-openai)

**sar4daniela** · Run Claude Code on OpenAI models · ⭐ 10

Exactly what it sounds like: a shim that lets you use Claude Code's interface with OpenAI's models. Useful for comparison testing or when you hit Claude rate limits. The existence of this suggests Claude Code's UX is good enough to port.

**Pulse insights:** The "Claude Code as interface, any model as backend" pattern is growing. Good for ecosystem diversity. We should ensure our plugins are model-agnostic where possible.

## Community Radar

### [Claude Agent Skills: A First Principles Deep Dive](https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/10/26/claude-skills-deep-dive/)

**[Lee Han Chung](https://leehanchung.github.io)** · Technical breakdown of how skills actually work

Lee reverse-engineers the skill system from first principles—context injection, two-message patterns, LLM-based routing. If you've wondered why skills behave the way they do, this explains the mechanics. Dense but rewarding.

**Pulse insights:** The "two-message pattern" explanation should be required reading before writing complex skills. We've been cargo-culting patterns without understanding why.

---

### [GitButler 0.16 - "Sweet Sixteen"](https://blog.gitbutler.com/gitbutler-0-16)

**[GitButler](https://blog.gitbutler.com)** · New release with Agents Tab and AI tool integrations

GitButler now has a dedicated Agents Tab for AI tool configuration. The integration story is getting smoother—less context-switching between Git client and terminal. The "rules" feature for commit policies is clever.

**Pulse insights:** GitButler is becoming the Git UI for the AI era. If you're not using it, you're making life harder than necessary.

---

### [Think First, AI Second](https://every.to/p/think-first-ai-second)

**[Every](https://every.to)** · Three principles for maintaining cognitive edge

Every's take on not becoming dependent on AI for thinking. The principles are simple but important: formulate your own hypothesis before asking, review AI output critically, maintain skills you could do manually. Good hygiene for power users.

**Pulse insights:** Worth internalizing. The "formulate before asking" principle applies directly to how we write prompts and skill descriptions.
