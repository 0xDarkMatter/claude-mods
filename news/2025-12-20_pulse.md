This week's throughline? The walls are coming down. Anthropic handed MCP to the Linux Foundation, OpenAI joined the founding board of an "Agentic AI Foundation," and skills became an open standard. After a year of proprietary land-grabs in AI tooling, the major players are suddenly playing nice—or at least pretending to. Meanwhile, Docker's betting big on local AI with voice agents and MCP toolkits, and OpenAI quietly shipped GPT-5.2-Codex optimized for "long-horizon work." The message is clear: 2025 is the year agents go from demos to deployments.

If you're building extensions for Claude Code, pay attention. The Agent Skills spec is now an open standard—meaning our skills might need to play nice with Cursor, OpenCode, and who knows what else. And the MCP Foundation gives us a stable target to build against. This isn't just governance news; it's the ground shifting under our feet.

## The Signal

### [Donating the Model Context Protocol and Establishing the Agentic AI Foundation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation)

**[Anthropic News](https://www.anthropic.com/news)** · December 9, 2025

Here's the thing: MCP was always meant to be open, but "open with Anthropic's blessing" is different from "open under the Linux Foundation." This week, Anthropic transferred MCP to the newly established Agentic AI Foundation—a directed fund with Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI as co-founders, plus backing from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg. That's basically everyone who matters agreeing that agent interoperability shouldn't be owned by one company.

The numbers tell the story: over 10,000 active public MCP servers, integrations in ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and VS Code. MCP won. Now it's getting the governance structure to match. Block's "goose" and OpenAI's "AGENTS.md" are also joining the foundation, suggesting a broader consolidation of agentic standards under one roof.

**Pulse insights:** This is legitimately good news for claude-mods. We've been building on MCP, and now we have assurance it won't fragment or get locked down. The foundation structure also means we can contribute upstream if we build something useful. Worth tracking the governance repo when it goes live.

### [Agent Skills: An Open Standard](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/agent-skills/)

**[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net)** · December 19, 2025

Anthropic converted their internal skills mechanism into an open specification living in its own GitHub repository. The spec is refreshingly brief—readable in minutes—and defines how agents discover and invoke capabilities. OpenCode, Cursor, Letta, and GitHub have already adopted it. Notably absent: OpenAI, who appears to be quietly building their own implementation.

The move mirrors what happened with MCP: start proprietary, prove the pattern, then hand it to the community. Skills were announced in October and hit critical mass by December. That's fast even by AI standards.

**Pulse insights:** Our `.claude/skills/` structure already follows this pattern, but we should audit against the official spec. If Cursor and OpenCode are adopting it, there's an interoperability play here—skills that work across Claude Code *and* competitors. That's a differentiator worth exploring.

## Official Updates

### [Sharing Our Compliance Framework for California's SB 53](https://www.anthropic.com/news/compliance-framework-SB53)

**[Anthropic News](https://www.anthropic.com/news)** · December 19, 2025

Anthropic released their compliance approach for California's Transparency in Frontier AI Act. This is governance work, but it matters—SB 53 sets requirements for how frontier AI systems document capabilities and safety measures. Anthropic publishing their framework publicly signals confidence and sets a template others might follow.

**Pulse insights:** Not directly relevant to claude-mods unless you're building enterprise tooling that needs compliance documentation. Bookmark for later.

### [Working with the US Department of Energy to Unlock Scientific Discovery](https://www.anthropic.com/news/genesis-mission-partnership)

**[Anthropic News](https://www.anthropic.com/news)** · December 18, 2025

Partnership with DOE on "Genesis Mission"—using Claude for scientific research acceleration. Details sparse, but signals Anthropic's push into specialized enterprise verticals beyond coding and writing.

**Pulse insights:** Keep an eye on whether DOE-specific tools or capabilities emerge. Government work sometimes spawns interesting OSS.

### [Protecting the Well-Being of Our Users](https://www.anthropic.com/news/protecting-well-being-of-users)

**[Anthropic News](https://www.anthropic.com/news)** · December 18, 2025

Anthropic's initiative addressing user safety in AI products—focused on mental health implications and responsible deployment. Part of their broader Constitutional AI work.

**Pulse insights:** Unlikely to affect Claude Code directly, but may influence how Claude responds in extended sessions.

## GitHub Discoveries

### [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

**Anthropic** · Official skills specification

The canonical home for the Agent Skills open standard. Includes the spec, examples, and adoption guidelines. Already seeing community contributions.

**Pulse insights:** Clone it, read it, check our skills against it. This is now the source of truth.

### [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)

**obra** · Core skills library with 20+ battle-tested patterns

Community library offering TDD, debugging, and collaboration skills for Claude Code. Worth reviewing for patterns we might adopt or improve upon.

**Pulse insights:** Competition and inspiration in one package. The TDD skill looks particularly well-designed.

### [Every.to](https://every.to) — OpenAI's Codex Playbook

[OpenAI Gave Us a Glimpse Into Their AI Coding Playbook](https://every.to/source-code/openai-gave-us-a-glimpse-into-their-ai-coding-playbook) dropped this week with lessons from the team that built Codex. Key insight: "treat Codex like a new coworker you're onboarding, not a tool." They built Sora's Android app in 28 days with four engineers. The bottleneck shifted from coding to architecture and review—sound familiar?

**Pulse insights:** The "onboarding not tooling" framing is worth internalizing. Our agents could benefit from this mental model.

### [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) — LLM Year in Review

Prolific week from Simon. Beyond the skills coverage: [Andrej Karpathy's 2025 LLM Year in Review](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/andrej-karpathy/) (RLVR as the new training paradigm), [GPT-5.2-Codex](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/19/introducing-gpt-52-codex/) (OpenAI's agent-optimized model for "long-horizon work"), and [Your Job Is to Deliver Code You've Proven Works](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/) (on junior devs depositing untested AI code).

**Pulse insights:** The "code proven to work" essay should be required reading. Pairs well with our `/testgen` and `/review` commands.

### [Docker Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog) — MCP Goes Mainstream

Docker's all-in on MCP this week. [Voice AI Apps with Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/develop-deploy-voice-ai-apps/) showcases EchoKit—an open-source voice agent orchestrator using Model Runner and MCP Toolkit. [Adding MCP Servers to ChatGPT](https://www.docker.com/blog/add-mcp-server-to-chatgpt/) shows the Docker MCP Toolkit connecting external tools to ChatGPT. The stack is maturing fast.

**Pulse insights:** EchoKit's architecture (VAD → ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline) is interesting for voice-first agents. Docker Model Runner + MCP could be a deployment target for our tools.

### [GitButler](https://blog.gitbutler.com) — Multi-Account Git

[Using GitButler with Multiple GitHub Accounts](https://blog.gitbutler.com/gitbutler-with-multiple-accounts/) addresses a real pain point for contractors and OSS contributors juggling identities.
