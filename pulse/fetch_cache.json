Each skill consists of a SKILL.md file with instructions, plus optional scripts and templates. Skills are model-invoked\u2014Claude automatically decides when to use them based on your request and the skill's description. They're the building blocks of Claude Code plugins and AI automation tools.\n\n\\*/\n\n02\n\n### Q:How do I install a Claude skill?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Skills can be installed in three ways: 1) Personal skills: Add to ~/.claude/skills/ directory for use across all projects, 2) Project skills: Add to .claude/skills/ directory and commit to git for team sharing, 3) Plugin skills: Install via Claude Code plugins using /plugin commands for one-command installation. Clone the GitHub repository and copy the skill folder (containing SKILL.md) to your chosen directory. Claude automatically discovers and loads skills from these locations.\n\n\\*/\n\n03\n\n### Q:Are these skills safe to use?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Skills from this marketplace are sourced from public GitHub repositories. We filter out low-quality repos (minimum 2 stars) and scan for basic quality indicators, but you should always review the code before installing. Community skills should be treated like any open-source code\u2014inspect before use.\n\n\\*/\n\n04\n\n### Q:Can I use multiple skills together?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Yes! Claude Code supports multiple skills simultaneously. Skills are modular and designed to work together. For example, you can combine a 'code-reviewer' skill with a 'git-automation' skill to automatically review and commit code changes. Claude intelligently selects the appropriate skills based on your request context.\n\n\\*/\n\n05\n\n### Q:Can I create and share my own skills?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Yes! You can create custom Claude skills and share them on GitHub. Check out the skill-creator skill for detailed guidance on creating your own skills. The basic structure requires a SKILL.md file with instructions. You can also add optional scripts, templates, and a marketplace.json for easier distribution.\n\n\\*/\n\n06\n\n### Q:How do skills differ from slash commands?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Skills are model-invoked\u2014Claude automatically decides when to use them based on context. Slash commands are user-invoked\u2014you explicitly type the command to trigger them. Skills enable more intelligent, context-aware automation in your workflows.\n\n\\*/\n\n07\n\n### Q:How often are skills updated?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* Our scraper regularly syncs with GitHub to fetch the latest skills and updates. When a skill repository is updated on GitHub, the changes will appear on SkillsMP shortly after our next sync. You can see the last update timestamp on each skill card. We recommend checking back regularly for new skills and improvements to existing ones.\n\n\\*/\n\n08\n\n### Q:What is marketplace.json?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* marketplace.json is a metadata file that enables one-command installation of skills through Claude Code plugin marketplaces. When present, users can install skills with a simple command like '/plugin install skill-name' instead of manually copying files. Skills with marketplace.json are marked with a special badge on SkillsMP. This file contains information about the skill's name, description, version, and installation instructions.\n\n\\*/\n\n09\n\n### Q:Is this website affiliated with Anthropic?\n\n\\[+\\]\n\n/\\*\\*\n\n\\\\* No, SkillsMP is an independent community project. We aggregate and showcase Claude skills from various sources to make discovery easier. For official skills and authoritative information, always refer to Anthropic's official documentation and repositories.\n\n\\*/\n\nStill have questions?\n\n[$open/docs&&explore](https://skillsmp.com/docs)\n\n$cdtop",

This can work fine\u2026 until it doesn\u2019t. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster has been partially blamed on this class of organizational failure.\n\nAs Johann puts it:\n\n> In the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.\n>\n> Vendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.\n>\n> The model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).\n>\n> However, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because \u201cit worked last time.\u201d\n>\n> This dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/normalization-of-deviance/) [8:18 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/normalization-of-deviance/)\n/ [security](https://simonwillison.net/tags/security/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [prompt-injection](https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [johann-rehberger](https://simonwillison.net/tags/johann-rehberger/), [ai-ethics](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics/)\n\nI've never been particularly invested dark v.s. light mode but I get enough people complaining that this site is \"blinding\" that I decided to see if Claude Code for web could produce a useful dark mode from my existing CSS. It did [a decent job](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/572/files), using CSS properties, `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and a `data-theme=\"dark\"` attribute based on this prompt:\n\n> `Add a dark theme which is triggered by user media preferences but can also be switched on using localStorage - then put a little icon in the footer for toggling it between default auto, forced regular and forced dark mode`\n\nThe site defaults to picking up the user's preferences, but there's also a toggle in the footer which switches between auto, forced-light and forced-dark. Here's an animated demo:\n\n![This site on mobile. Clicking the icon in the footer switches to a black background with readable text.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/dark-mode.gif)\n\nI had Claude Code [make me that GIF](https://gistpreview.github.io/?5ea34de3e999bd32d0f86beef4bd803d) from two static screenshots - it used this ImageMagick recipe:\n\n```\nmagick -delay 300 -loop 0 one.png two.png \\\n    -colors 128 -layers Optimize dark-mode.gif\n```\n\nThe CSS ended up with some duplication due to the need to handle both the media preference and the explicit user selection.

This restriction in (b) applies to the Model and any derivatives, modifications, or combined works based on it, whether provided by Mistral AI or by a third party. \\[...\\]\n\nMistral Small 2 is under a proper Apache 2 license with no weird strings attached. It's a 24B model which is [51.6GB on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2-24B-Instruct-2512) and should quantize to significantly less.\n\nI tried out the larger model via [my llm-mistral plugin](https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral) like this:\n\n```\nllm install llm-mistral\nllm mistral refresh\nllm -m mistral/devstral-2512 \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\"\n```\n\n![Bicycle looks a bit like a cybertruck](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-2.jpg)\n\nFor a ~120B model that one is pretty good!\n\nHere's the same prompt with `-m mistral/labs-devstral-small-2512` for the API hosted version of Devstral Small 2:\n\n![A small white pelican on what looks more like a child's cart.](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/devstral-small-2.jpg)\n\nAgain, a decent result given the small parameter size.

He wrote about this previously in [Using Coding Agents to Decompile Nintendo 64 Games](https://blog.chrislewis.au/using-coding-agents-to-decompile-nintendo-64-games/), describing his efforts to decompile Snowboard Kids 2 ( [released in 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboard_Kids_2)) using a \"matching\" process:\n\n> The matching decompilation process involves analysing the MIPS assembly, inferring its behaviour, and writing C that, when compiled with the same toolchain and settings, reproduces the exact code: same registers, delay slots, and instruction order. \\[...\\]\n>\n> A good match is more than just C code that compiles to the right bytes. It should look like something an N64-era developer would plausibly have written: simple, idiomatic C control flow and sensible data structures.\n\nChris was getting some useful results from coding agents earlier on, but this [new post](https://blog.chrislewis.au/the-unexpected-effectiveness-of-one-shot-decompilation-with-claude/) describes how a switching to a new processing Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Code has massively accelerated the project - as demonstrated started by this chart on [the decomp.dev page](https://decomp.dev/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp?mode=history) for his project:\n\n![Chart showing progress in matching code for Snowboard Kids 2. It slowly climbs from 20% to 25% from 3rd September to 17th November, then rises quickly to 45% by 2nd December](https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/decomp-progress.jpg)\n\nHere's [the prompt he was using](https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/852f47a4905a08d5d652387597bc5b47d29582f2/CLAUDE.md).\n\nThe big productivity boost was unlocked by switching to use Claude Code in non-interactive mode and having it tackle the less complicated functions (aka the lowest hanging fruit) first. Here's the relevant code from the [driving Bash script](https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/785db3cb0ce356e57ea5016835499fd6b393c490/tools/vacuum.sh#L44-L54):\n\n```\nsimplest_func=$(python3 tools/score_functions.py asm/nonmatchings/ 2>&1)\n# ...\noutput=$(claude -p \"decompile the function $simplest_func\" 2>&1 | tee -a tools/vacuum.log)\n```\n\n[score\\_functions.py](https://github.com/cdlewis/snowboardkids2-decomp/blob/785db3cb0ce356e57ea5016835499fd6b393c490/tools/score_functions.py) uses some heuristics to decide which of the remaining un-matched functions look to be the least complex.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/6/one-shot-decompilation/) [6:30 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/6/one-shot-decompilation/)\n/ [games](https://simonwillison.net/tags/games/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [prompt-engineering](https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [ai-assisted-programming](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/), [coding-agents](https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents/), [claude-code](https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code/)\n\n> If you work slowly, you will be more likely to stick with your slightly obsolete work.

In order to scale software, you had to build for the average user, sanding away the edge cases. In many ways, this is why our digital world has come to resemble the sterile, deadening architecture that Alexander spent his career pushing back against.\n>\n> This is where AI provides a missing puzzle piece. Software can now respond fluidly to the context and particularity of each human\u2014at scale. One-size-fits-all is no longer a technological or economic necessity. Where once our digital environments inevitably shaped us against our will, we can now build technology that _adaptively shapes itself_ in service of our individual and collective aspirations.\n\nThere are echos here of the [Malleable software concept](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/) from Ink & Switch.\n\nThe manifesto proposes five principles for building resonant software: Keeping data **private** and under personal stewardship, building software that's **dedicated** to the user's interests, ensuring **plural** and distributed control rather than platform monopolies, making tools **adaptable** to individual context, and designing for **prosocial** membership of shared spaces.\n\nSteven Levy talked to the manifesto's lead instigator Alex Komoroske and provides some extra flavor in [It's Time to Save Silicon Valley From Itself](https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-techdirt-mike-masnick-common-tools-alex-komoroske/):\n\n> By 2025, it was clear to Komoroske and his cohort that Big Tech had strayed far from its early idealistic principles. As Silicon Valley began to align itself more strongly with political interests, the idea emerged within the group to lay out a different course, and a casual suggestion led to a process where some in the group began drafting what became today\u2019s manifesto. They chose the word \u201cresonant\u201d to describe their vision mainly because of its positive connotations. As the document explains, \u201cIt\u2019s the experience of encountering something that speaks to our deeper values.\u201d\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/5/resonant-computing/) [1:19 am](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/5/resonant-computing/)\n/ [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [alex-komoroske](https://simonwillison.net/tags/alex-komoroske/), [ai-ethics](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics/)\n\n### Dec. 4, 2025\n\n**[Django 6.0 released](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/dec/03/django-60-released/)**.\nDjango 6.0 includes a [flurry of neat features](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/), but the two that most caught my eye are **background workers** and **template partials**.\n\nBackground workers started out as [DEP (Django Enhancement Proposal) 14](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0014-background-workers.rst), proposed and shepherded by Jake Howard. Jake prototyped the feature in [django-tasks](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks) and wrote [this extensive background on the feature](https://theorangeone.net/posts/django-dot-tasks-exists/) when it landed in core just in time for the 6.0 feature freeze back in September.\n\nKevin Wetzels published a useful [first look at Django's background tasks](https://roam.be/notes/2025/a-first-look-at-djangos-new-background-tasks/) based on the earlier RC, including notes on building a custom database-backed worker implementation.\n\n[Template Partials](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/language/#template-partials) were implemented as a Google Summer of Code project by Farhan Ali Raza. I really like the design of this. Here's an example from [the documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/templates/language/#inline-partials) showing the neat `inline` attribute which lets you both use and define a partial at the same time:\n\n```\n{# Define and render immediately. #}\n{% partialdef user-info inline %}\n    <div id=\"user-info-{{ user.username }}\">\n        <h3>{{ user.name }}</h3>\n        <p>{{ user.bio }}</p>\n    </div>\n{% endpartialdef %}\n\n{# Other page content here. #}\n\n{# Reuse later elsewhere in the template. #}\n<section class=\"featured-authors\">\n    <h2>Featured Authors</h2>\n    {% for user in featured %}\n        {% partial user-info %}\n    {% endfor %}\n</section>\n```\n\nYou can also render just a named partial from a template directly in Python code like this:\n\n```\nreturn render(request, \"authors.html#user-info\", {\"user\": user})\n```\n\nI'm looking forward to trying this out in combination with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).\n\nI asked [Claude Code to dig around in my blog's source code](https://gistpreview.github.io/?8db0c1a50aad95d5bc5b5b7d66a503ab) looking for places that could benefit from a template partial. Here's [the resulting commit](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/9b1a6b99140b43e869ada3348ce4d4407e9a06ba) that uses them to de-duplicate the display of dates and tags from pages that list multiple types of content, such as [my tag pages](https://simonwillison.net/tags/django/).\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/4/django-6/) [11:57 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/4/django-6/)\n/ [django](https://simonwillison.net/tags/django/), [python](https://simonwillison.net/tags/python/), [ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai/), [generative-ai](https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai/), [llms](https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms/), [ai-assisted-programming](https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/), [htmx](https://simonwillison.net/tags/htmx/), [coding-agents](https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents/), [claude-code](https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code/)\n\nI take tap dance evening classes at the [College of San Mateo](https://collegeofsanmateo.edu/) community college.

Their announcement includes an impressive revenue update on Claude Code:\n\n> In November, Claude Code achieved a significant milestone: just six months after becoming available to the public, it reached $1 billion in run-rate revenue.\n\nHere \"run-rate revenue\" means that their current monthly revenue would add up to $1bn/year.\n\nI've been watching Anthropic's published revenue figures with interest: their annual revenue run rate was $1 billion in January 2025 and had grown to $5 billion [by August 2025](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation) and to $7 billion [by October](https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-dario-amodei-american-ai-leadership).\n\nI had suspected that a large chunk of this was down to Claude Code - given that $1bn figure I guess a large chunk of the rest of the revenue comes from their API customers, since Claude Sonnet/Opus are extremely popular models for coding assistant startups.\n\nBun founder Jarred Sumner [explains the acquisition here](https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic). They still had plenty of runway after their $26m raise but did not yet have any revenue:\n\n> Instead of putting our users & community through \"Bun, the VC-backed startups tries to figure out monetization\" \u2013 thanks to Anthropic, we can skip that chapter entirely and focus on building the best JavaScript tooling. \\[...\\] When people ask \"will Bun still be around in five or ten years?\", answering with \"we raised $26 million\" isn't a great answer. \\[...\\]\n>\n> Anthropic is investing in Bun as the infrastructure powering Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, and future AI coding products. Our job is to make Bun the best place to build, run, and test AI-driven software \u2014 while continuing to be a great general-purpose JavaScript runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner.\n\n[#](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/anthropic-acquires-bun/) [6:40 pm](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/2/anthropic-acquires-bun/)\n/ [javascript](https://simonwillison.",

This is the most straightforward but a benefit of having that functionality on the backend is you don't allow a malicious frontend to insert extra stuff into what gets sent to the Anthropic API.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u2022 Move all the work done by apiMessages in appinancepage.tsx to be done on the backend. More work but maybe a better practice to follow?\n\n\u200d\n\nThis is an example app, so maybe the security aspect isn't worth worrying about here. At the very least I found it confusing to have this functionality in both places because I initially modified what was in route.ts and it took me a while to figure out why the change wasn't having any effect (I actually needed to make the change in page.tsx).\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Let me examine the affected files to fix the issue:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Read(file\\_path: \"app/api/finance/route.ts\")\u2026\n\n\u23bf // app/api/finance/route.ts\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Read(file\\_path: \"app/finance/page.tsx\")\u2026\n\n\u23bf // app/finance/page.tsx\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Now I'll fix the issue by updating the route.ts file to remove unused fileData code since the frontend constructs the messages for the API:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Update(file\\_path: app/api/finance/route.ts)\u2026\n\n\u23bf Updated app/api/finance/route.ts with 3 additions and 67 removals\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Let me make sure that I've fixed all instances referring to the unused fileData in the code:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Search(pattern: \"fileData\", path: \"app/api/finance\")\u2026\n\n\u23bf Found 0 files\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Great, there are no more instances of fileData in the route.ts file. Now let's run the lint check to ensure our changes don't cause any issues:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Bash(cd /Users/user/code/anthropic-quickstarts/financial-data-analyst && npm run lint)\u2026\n\n\u23bf\n\n\\> financial-assistant@0.1.0 lint\n\n\\> next lint\n\n\u2714 No ESLint warnings or errors\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Now let's run the tests:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Call(Check package.json and run dev to test)\u2026\n\n\u23bf Read(file\\_path: \"package.json\")\u2026\n\n\u23bf Bash(cd /Users/user/code/anthropic-quickstarts/financial-data-analyst && npm run build)\u2026\n\n\u23bf Done (2 tool uses \u00b7 41.3s)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Now that we've fixed the issue, let's wrap this up with a commit:\n\n\u200d\n\n\u23fa Bash(cd /Users/user/code/anthropic-quickstarts/financial-data-analyst && git commit -m \"Fix unused fileData code in finance API route \u2026\n\n\u200d\n\nThis commit addresses issue #234 by removing unnecessary fileData processing code in the API route.

The issue identified that fileData processing in route.ts was redundant since the frontend already formats all messages properly. I examined both files, confirmed the issue was valid, and made these changes:\n\n\u200d\n\n\\- Removed all fileData handling code in route.ts\n\n\\- Updated the route to use messages directly from the frontend\n\n\\- Added a clear comment explaining the change\n\n\\- Ran lint and build tests to verify everything works\n\n\\- Created a commit with a descriptive message\n\n\\- Attempted to close the issue (would have succeeded with proper permissions)\n\n.\n\nThis is some text inside of a div block.\n\n>\n\nRefactor the permission request components to share common UI elements and behavior.\n\n\u23fa I'll refactor the permission request components to share common UI elements and behavior by creating a BasePermissionRequest component.

Here's a summary of what we accomplished:\n\n1\\. Created a new BasePermissionRequest component that handles common UI elements and behavior:\n\n\\- Standardized border, layout, and styling\n\n\\- Common input handling (ESC key, number shortcuts)\n\n\\- Unified permission prompt structure\n\n2\\. Updated permission request logging in utils.ts to make it more flexible\n\n3\\. Refactored FallbackPermissionRequest and WebFetchPermissionRequest to use the base component:\n\n\\- Reduced code duplication\n\n\\- Improved consistency between different permission requests\n\n\\- Made it easier to maintain permission UI going forward\n\n4\\. Fixed test failures by updating the test assertions to work with the new UI structure\n\n5\\. Ensured all tests pass and the code passes linting\n\nThis refactoring will make it easier to add new permission request types in the future and maintain consistent behavior across all permission requests.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Code onboarding\n\nClaude Code maps and explains entire codebases in a few seconds.
