# Summon

Claude Desktop session toolbox. Four jobs, one store:

| Mode | Invocation | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Transfer** (default) | `summon [flags]` | Copy/move sessions across accounts so they're visible from the account you switch to next |
| **Pick / Recover** | `summon pick` · `summon recover <id>` | Find a past session, resolve its transcript, distill a handover brief, emit a paste-ready handover for a new session |
| **Rebind** | `summon rebind <id> --cwd <newpath>` | Fix a session's recorded cwd after the project folder moved |
| **Doctor** | `summon doctor [--json]` | Scan every session for broken cwd bindings; report which need rebinding |

Transfer touches no transcripts and makes no API calls. Recover/pick make exactly one optional, gated LLM call (the distillation) and degrade gracefully without it. Transfer is documented first; the toolbox modes follow under [Toolbox modes](#toolbox-modes-pick--recover--rebind--doctor).

## When to run it

**Before you switch accounts**, not after. The natural workflow:

1. Notice you're approaching usage limit on the account you're currently using
2. Run `summon --to <next-account>` — sessions get copied (default) into the next account's dir
3. Logout from current account in Desktop → Login to the new account
4. **All your mid-flight sessions appear in the new account's left-hand session picker** (the sidebar on the left side of Desktop's Code tab). The Logout/Login is the natural switch you were going to do anyway.

Running summon *after* hitting the usage limit also works — the file moves are pure local ops, no API needed — but you'll still need to Logout/Login on the destination to see the sessions, since Desktop's session list is cached at login. Doing it proactively just means the Logout/Login is no longer "extra friction," it's the same step you'd be doing anyway.

## Mental model

Each Desktop session has two halves:

| Half | Location | Account-bound? |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Metadata JSON | `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude-code-sessions/<account>/<workspace>/local_<uuid>.json` | **Yes** — lives under `<account>` |
| Transcript JSONL | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<cli-uuid>.jsonl` | **No** — global, shared |

Summon copies (or with `--move`, relocates) the metadata wrapper into the destination account's dir. The transcript stays put — both wrappers point at the same conversation. After Logout/Login on the destination, the new entries appear in the **left-hand session picker** (Desktop's Code-tab sidebar).

**The uuid-mismatch trap.** The wrapper filename uuid (`local_<uuid>.json` / `sessionId`) does **not** name the transcript — the transcript file is named by the wrapper's `cliSessionId`, a different uuid (e.g. wrapper `local_6577b24c-…` → transcript `e640a2a8-….jsonl`). And the transcript's parent dir is the *munged cwd* (`X:\Roam\LCMap\.claude\worktrees\funny-hypatia-5e54f7` → `X--Roam-LCMap--claude-worktrees-funny-hypatia-5e54f7`), which occasionally doesn't derive from the wrapper's recorded cwd at all. All toolbox modes resolve via `cliSessionId` at the expected munged path first, then fall back to scanning every project dir for `<cliSessionId>.jsonl`.

## Run

```bash
# Wrapper (after install — see below)
summon [flags]

# Or direct
python ~/.claude/skills/summon/scripts/summon.py [flags]
```

Default behaviour: list candidate sessions across **all non-destination accounts**, grouped Account → Project → Session, then prompt to copy them into the destination account. **Copy semantics by default** — sessions remain visible in the source account too. Last 3 days; remote-VM sessions auto-skipped.

Two natural framings of the same operation:

- **Push** (proactive): you're approaching usage limit on your current account. Run `summon --to <next-account>` while still on the current one. Pick which sessions to push. Then Logout/Login is the account switch you were going to do anyway.
- **Pull** (rescue): you've already switched accounts and want to bring earlier sessions over. Run `summon` (no `--to`); destination defaults to your now-current account.

Mechanically identical — the file moves are the same regardless of which framing you have in mind. Push is the recommended workflow because the Logout/Login becomes invisible.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--to <account>` | most-recently-active account | Destination — where the sessions land. Specify when **pushing** to a different account; omit when **pulling** into your current account. UUID prefix or email substring |
| `--from <account>` | all non-destination accounts | Restrict source to one account |
| `--days N` | 3 | Time window |
| `--all` | | Disable time filter |
| `--cwd <pattern>` | | Substring match against session cwd |
| `--title <pattern>` | | Substring match against session title |
| `--pick` | | Interactive multi-select by number |
| `--move` | | Move instead of copy — delete source after copying (lean cleanup) |
| `--dry-run` | | Preview without touching files |
| `--list-accounts` | | Show all accounts and exit |
| `--peek <id>` | | Preview a session's last messages and exit (id prefix or full) |
| `--flat` | | Flat list instead of grouped hierarchy |
| `--select <picks>` | | Non-interactive selection: `--select "1,2,4"` or `--select all`. Replaces the picker prompt for scripted callers |
| `--yes` | | Skip the final confirmation prompt only — selection is still required (picker prompt, piped stdin, or `--select`) |

## Toolbox modes (pick / recover / rebind / doctor)

Semantic exit codes across all modes: `0` ok, `2` usage/ambiguous id, `3` session or path not found, `10` doctor found broken sessions.

### `summon pick` — session picker → distilled handover

Interactive picker over the **whole** session store (all accounts, default last 30 days — `--days N`/`--all` to widen, `--cwd`/`--title` to narrow). Uses `fzf` when it's on PATH and the terminal is interactive; falls back to a numbered list (`--select N` answers it non-interactively). A `●` marks sessions active in the last 10 minutes — don't recover a session that's still running.

Selecting a session emits a **paste-ready handover on stdout** (context panel and progress on stderr, so `summon pick | clip` stays clean). Same output as `recover`, below.

**`summon pick --json`** skips the picker entirely and emits the filtered inventory as a `claude-mods.summon.pick/v1` envelope on stdout — JSON only, no panel glyphs (an empty inventory is `"data": []` with exit 0, not an error). Each session row carries: `id` (short) + `sessionId` (full) + `cliSessionId`, `title`, `cwd`, `projectRoot` + `worktree` (the cwd with any `\.claude\worktrees\<name>` suffix split out), `branch`, `model` + `effort`, `turns`, `isArchived`, `isRunning` (active in the last 10m), `brokenCwd` (doctor's check — recorded cwd missing on disk), `lastActivityAt` (ISO-8601 Z), `account` + `accountEmail`, and `transcriptPath` (resolved via the same wrapper→transcript logic as recover, scan fallback included; `null` when missing). This feeds the [in-chat visual card picker](#in-chat-mode-visual-card-picker--the-default-for-picking-sessions) and any scripted caller:

```bash
summon pick --json | jq -r '.data[] | "\(.id)  \(.title)  \(.projectRoot)"'
```

**`summon pick --json --rich`** advances the schema to `claude-mods.summon.pick/v2` and adds transcript-derived **display metrics** to every row — one linear transcript read each, so it's opt-in (the plain `--json` inventory stays metadata-only and instant). Extra keys: `events` (transcript line count), `toolCalls`, `densityBuckets` (24-bucket activity histogram over the session's lifetime), `durationMin`, `sizeKB` (on-disk transcript size), `ctxTokens` (last-turn context occupancy — input + cache + output, matching Claude Code's live meter), `ctxPeak` (max before any auto-compaction), `ctxWindow` (200000, or 1000000 when peak exceeds 200k), `ctxPct` / `ctxPeakPct`, and `firstAsk` (the session's opening ask, boilerplate-stripped). This is the feed for the card picker.

### `summon recover <id>` — distilled handover brief

`summon recover 6577b24c` — id is a `sessionId` or `cliSessionId`, prefix ok. Four-stage flow:

1. **Extract** (in-script, no LLM): parses the transcript JSONL and pulls conversational content only — user/assistant text turns, skipping `tool_result` blobs and `tool_use` inputs (they are most of the bytes). The final ~15 turns are included verbatim; earlier turns fill the remaining budget from the start (so the goal statement survives), middle elided when too long. Total capped at a char budget (`--budget`, default 120k).
2. **Distill** (cheap, tool-less): pipes the extraction to a single `claude -p --model sonnet --permission-mode dontAsk` call — one-shot stdin summarisation, no tools, no agentic loop, never `bypassPermissions` (per `rules/loop-engineering.md`). Produces a brief with fixed sections: **Goal / What landed** (branch + commits if mentioned) **/ Unfinished / Open decisions / Key context**, ~1k-word cap. `--model` overrides sonnet.
3. **Cache**: the brief is written to `<transcript-path>.handover.md` next to the JSONL and reused while it's newer than the transcript's mtime. `--refresh` forces re-distillation.
4. **Emit** (stdout = the data product): the brief inline plus a pointer clause:

```
Continue a previous Claude session: 'Fix overlapping photo pins with gentle displacement'.
Branch: claude/funny-hypatia-5e54f7

## Goal
…
## What landed
…
## Unfinished
…
## Open decisions
…
## Key context
…

Full transcript at C:\Users\Mack\.claude\projects\X--Roam-LCMap-…\e640a2a8-….jsonl (session 6577b24c-…, branch claude/funny-hypatia-5e54f7); consult it only if something specific is missing.
```

**Degrade, never hard-fail**: if the `claude` CLI is absent from PATH, or the call fails/times out (60s), recover falls back to the classic non-distilled pointer prompt (Title/Branch/Orig cwd/Transcript + tail-reading instruction) with a stderr warning and **exit 0** — worker unavailability is advisory, not an error. `--no-distill` forces the fallback (no LLM call at all).

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--no-distill` | | Skip the LLM distillation; emit the plain pointer prompt |
| `--refresh` | | Ignore a cached `<transcript>.handover.md` and re-distill |
| `--model <m>` | `sonnet` | Model for the distillation call |
| `--budget <n>` | `120000` | Char budget for the transcript extraction fed to the distiller |

### `summon rebind <id> --cwd <newpath>` — fix cwd after a folder move

When a project folder moves (e.g. `X:\Roam\LCMap` → `X:\Maplab\LCMap`), sessions bound to the old cwd fail to restart in the Desktop UI. Rebind repairs the binding:

```bash
summon rebind 6577b24c --cwd "X:\Maplab\LCMap\.claude\worktrees\funny-hypatia-5e54f7"
```

1. **Backs up** every matching wrapper to `~/.claude/summon-backups/<timestamp>/` (outside the live store) before touching anything
2. **Atomically rewrites** `cwd`, and rebases `originCwd`/`worktreePath` (worktree sessions record the project *root* in `originCwd` — the suffix math is handled)
3. **Bridges the transcript**: Desktop resolves the transcript via the munged *new* cwd, so the `<cliSessionId>.jsonl` is copied (never moved) into the new munged project dir. `--no-transcript` skips this
4. **Verifies** by re-reading the wrapper; on mismatch it restores from the backup
5. If the same session was transfer-copied into several accounts, **all copies are rebound**
6. When the new cwd is inside a `.claude\worktrees\` path, prints a reminder that **git worktree links break on folder moves** — run `git worktree repair <new-worktree-path>` from the repo root (verified fix 2026-07-03 on X:\Maplab\LCMap)

`--dry-run` previews; `--force` allows a `--cwd` that doesn't exist yet. The new cwd must normally exist on disk. After a rebind, restart Desktop (or Logout/Login) so the sidebar re-reads the wrapper.

Wrapper edit + backup + transcript bridge are verified against the live store (throwaway-session test, 2026-07-03). End-to-end "session reopens in the Desktop UI after rebind" — confirm on your first real rebind before bulk-rebinding.

### `summon doctor` — find broken sessions

Scans **every** wrapper (all accounts, all time) and reports sessions whose recorded cwd no longer exists on disk, with a ready-made `summon rebind <id> --cwd <new-location>` line per finding. Also counts transcript-missing and found-by-scan sessions. Exit `10` when anything is broken; `--json` emits a `claude-mods.summon.doctor/v1` envelope for scripted use:

```bash
summon doctor --json | jq -r '.data[] | "\(.sessionId)  \(.cwd)"'
```

Broken-cwd findings are mostly **pruned worktrees** (the session ended, the worktree was cleaned — nothing to fix unless you want to recover it, which needs no rebind: `summon recover` works regardless of cwd) and **moved project folders** (the real rebind case).

## In-chat mode (visual card picker) — the default for picking sessions

When summon is invoked from **inside a Claude chat session** (Desktop chat, claude.ai), the terminal picker can't run interactively — stdin isn't a TTY, so fzf and the numbered prompt are out. **This card picker is the default way to present sessions in chat** — reach for it whenever the user asks to see, pick, recover, or summon sessions, not just when they say "picker".

1. Run **`summon widget --days 30`** (add `--cwd`/`--title` filters as asked). It prints the **finished, self-contained card-picker HTML on stdout** — the rich inventory already trimmed and injected into the template.
2. **Pass that stdout straight to the `show_widget` tool** as `widget_code`. That's the whole job: no manual injection, no key-trimming, no reading a file back. The builder also writes the same HTML to `%TEMP%\claude\summon-widget.html` (override with `--out`), so you can `Read` it if you'd rather not re-run.

> **Why one command, not hand-assembly (don't "simplify" this away).** `show_widget` accepts only **inline** `widget_code` — no file path — and its CSP blocks any fetch, so the session data *must* be inlined. The old manual flow (`pick --json --rich` → hand-merge data into the template → `Read` the assembled file to inline it) was expensive and broke: `--rich` for ~75 sessions is >100 KB (it spools to a tool-results file), and once injected as one long JSON line the assembled file **trips the 25k-token `Read` cap and can't be paginated** (Read is line-based; the megaline is indivisible). `summon widget` fixes all of it in-process: it drops 0-turn stubs, caps to the most-recently-active `--limit` (default 24), keeps only the keys the template consumes, downsamples the density strip, injects **one session object per line** (so `Read` *can* paginate the mirror file), and holds the assembled HTML under a hard **`--max-kb` byte budget** (default 28 KB ≈ <15k tokens) so it never spools and never trips the Read cap — capping the session count with a stderr note if it must. Flags: `--include-stubs`, `--full-density`, `--limit N`, `--max-kb N`, `--days N`/`--all`, `--out PATH`.

The widget itself needs no further setup: archived sessions are hidden by default (a "show archived" toggle reveals them); cross-account copies dedupe by `sessionId`; it has a client-side age filter (24h/3d/7d/30d/all — `summon widget` pre-selects the one matching `--days`) so the user narrows in-widget without a CLI re-run. Each card shows a **colour-coded context-usage gauge chip** (token count + % of the session's window — 200k or 1M, auto-detected from peak; green/amber/red by fill) in the stats row, an **activity-density strip**, and chips for model/effort, age, turns, messages, tool calls, on-disk size, and duration, plus **grid/list** and **sort** controls. The header stays light — just project, tags, and the action icons (grouped right, wrap-safe) — so nothing overruns the card border. `firstAsk` is the mechanical opening ask; you MAY replace it with a distilled one-liner by setting a `summary` field on a row (edit the mirror file or post-process the JSON) before rendering.

**Manual fallback (only if `summon widget` is unavailable):** run **`summon pick --json --rich --days 30`**, parse the `claude-mods.summon.pick/v2` envelope, drop its `data` array into the `<script id="D">` block of [`assets/picker-widget.html`](assets/picker-widget.html) (the widget consumes pick/v2 objects verbatim — keys documented in the template header), and render via `show_widget`. Watch the Read-cap trap above: keep the injected array one-object-per-line and trim to a couple dozen sessions.

3. Act on the `sendPrompt` callbacks the widget fires. Per-card `↗ summon` and `⟳ recover` (and the footer's "Recover/Summon selected") are worded to be **spawned as background chips** — when one arrives, call `spawn_task` (one chip per session) rather than doing the work inline, so the user's current turn keeps flowing:
   - **"Recover … as a background chip"** → one `spawn_task` per session (the batch button sends a single prompt listing all selected — fan it into one chip **per session**, not one mega-chip, so each recovers independently in its own project folder). For each chip:
     - **Title = the original session name, verbatim** (e.g. `revoicing`) — never a `Recover "…" session` label. The chip should look like a continuation of the original in the sidebar, not a new errand.
     - **`cwd` = the session's project root** (strip any `\.claude\worktrees\<name>` suffix).
     - Word the prompt so the chip *is* the recovered session: it reads the original transcript (resolve via `summon recover <id>` / the wrapper→transcript logic), writes a hand-off brief, and **resumes the work in place** in the project folder. The chip must **not** spawn a further chip and must **not** open the original worktree path as a separate session — that path is reference-only, for locating the branch and any in-progress changes. (The failure mode this prevents: a chip prompt that says "start a fresh session there" plus a worktree path makes the recovering chip spawn a *second* chip into the worktree. The chip already **is** the fresh session — tell it to continue, not to spawn.)
   - **"Summon (copy) these…"** → transfer flow: `summon` with `--select` for exactly those sessions, `--dry-run` preview first, then the real run once the user confirms.
   - **"Peek session…"** → `summon --peek <id>`.

The template is deliberately self-contained: host CSS variables + the host's Tabler `ti` webfont (both available in the `show_widget` context, light/dark safe), no external assets, and the host-provided `sendPrompt(text)` bridge for the buttons. **Chat contexts only** — terminal users keep the fzf/numbered picker; don't route a TTY user through the widget.

## Auto-detect rules

- **Destination**: account with the most recent filesystem activity (mtime of any session JSON). This reliably tracks the active Desktop account.
- **Source**: by default, all accounts except destination. Use `--from <account>` to restrict to one.
- **Workspace dir under destination**: most-recently-active existing workspace. New UUID is created if the destination has no workspaces yet.

## Display

Output follows the [Terminal Panel Design System](../../docs/TERMINAL-DESIGN.md) (panel header, body with `│` rail, footer, ASCII fallback when stdout isn't UTF-8). The candidate hierarchy is **Account → Project → Session**, with sessions globally numbered for picker selection (`3, 5, 7`).

Header shows `→ destination`. Summary line shows count, source breadth, and active filter window. Body shows Account → Project → Session hierarchy with global numbering for picker selection (`3,5,7`). A rotating hint tile sits above the footer; the footer shows the active hotkeys.

## Edge cases handled

| Case | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| Session cwd is `/sessions/<vm>/mnt` (remote) | Skipped — no local transcript to bridge |
| Transcript JSONL missing on disk | Skipped with warning (orphan metadata) |
| Same `sessionId` already in destination | Skipped (idempotent) |
| Destination has no workspace dirs | New workspace UUID created |
| Stdout is not UTF-8 (Windows cp1252) | ASCII fallback for all panel glyphs |
| Stdout is not a TTY or `NO_COLOR` set | Plain text, no ANSI escapes |

## Sidebar refresh

Desktop loads sessions into its left-hand session picker on login and doesn't watch the filesystem afterwards (verified via bundle inspection — no `chokidar`, no relevant `fs.watch` on the session dir, only direct `fs.readdir` calls). Summon throws a best-effort nudge at fs.watch (sentinel pings, mtime touches, rename ping-pong) but **don't rely on it** — assume Logout/Login is required to populate the sidebar with new sessions.

This is why summon is best run **before switching accounts**: the Logout/Login is what you'd do anyway. Running summon as a "rescue" after the fact still works mechanically, but the Logout/Login still has to happen.

If sessions still don't appear:

1. Try View → Reload (rarely helps; Ctrl+R only re-renders)
2. **Logout → Login** triggers a full filesystem rescan and always works

## Wrapper install

Symlink (or copy) the wrapper into a directory on `PATH`:

```bash
# Linux/macOS/Git Bash
ln -s ~/.claude/skills/summon/bin/summon ~/.local/bin/summon

# Windows (PowerShell)
copy "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\summon\bin\summon.cmd" "$env:USERPROFILE\bin\summon.cmd"
```

Then `summon pick`, `summon doctor`, etc. work directly from any shell.

## Architecture reference

Full file system layout, session schemas, account binding, and the validated cross-account transfer procedure live in `docs/references/claude-desktop-internals.md` (claude-mods). That document is canonical; this skill is the operating manual.

## Anti-patterns

- **Waiting until you've already hit the limit** — the file moves still work, but you've burned the chance to wrap up your current message before switching. Run summon proactively while you still have usage on the source.
- **Expecting sessions to appear in the sidebar without Logout/Login** — Desktop's session list is loaded on login; the kitchen-sink fs.watch nudge is best-effort and shouldn't be relied on. The Logout/Login becomes painless if you've timed summon as a *push* before switching.
- **Running while Desktop is mid-write to a session JSON** — quit Desktop first if you've literally just closed the session you want to push.
- **Trying to summon remote sessions** — they have no local transcript and can't be transferred.
- **Hardcoding account UUIDs** — use `--list-accounts` first, then email substring (more readable, less brittle).
- **Treating this as a transfer for archived sessions** — it's for mid-flight work; archived sessions belong in the source account's archive view.
- **Using `--move` for sessions you might want to access from both accounts** — copy is default precisely because multi-account workflows are the common case.
- **Rebinding without checking the new path** — `rebind` refuses a nonexistent `--cwd` for a reason; a typo'd rebind is two edits instead of one. `--force` is for pre-creating bindings, not for skipping the check.
- **Recovering by pasting the whole transcript** — the handover brief exists so the new session starts from a distilled summary and consults the JSONL only for specifics. Feeding a full multi-MB transcript into a fresh session burns the context you were trying to save.
- **Re-distilling on every recover** — the brief is cached at `<transcript>.handover.md` and reused while the transcript is unchanged; reach for `--refresh` only when the session has genuinely moved on since the cache was written.
