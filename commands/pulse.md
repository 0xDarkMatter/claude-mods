description: "**[MOVED]** Claude Code ecosystem news digest. Now at github.com/0xDarkMatter/pulse"
---

# Pulse

> **This command has been moved to a standalone repository.**

## New Location

**Repository:** [github.com/0xDarkMatter/pulse](https://github.com/0xDarkMatter/pulse)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/0xDarkMatter/pulse.git

# Copy the command to your Claude Code commands
cp pulse/COMMAND.md ~/.claude/commands/pulse.md
```

## Why It Moved

Pulse generates persistent state files and news digests that don't belong in a shared plugin repo. As a standalone tool, it can:

- Track its own state without cluttering claude-mods
- Have dedicated issue tracking for source curation
- Evolve independently from the plugin release cycle
